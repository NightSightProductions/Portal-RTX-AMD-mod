 FSR 3.1 can be toggled through ALT + X and changing upscaler to DLSS

 Warning: While in ALT + X dev menu, do not go to the remix graphics menu, this will revert some changes and reduce performance (Only if using TAA-U or NIS, Does not affect FSR)

 If you need support, you can join our discord through the mod site

  How to know your architecture:
   RDNA 2: 6000 series, 600m series
   RDNA 3: 7000 series, 700m series

Note: Handhelds with Z1/Z1 Extreme APUs use 700m graphics

 We would love feedback for other GPUs

Special thanks to the Optiscaler team for helping us get FSR 3.1 working, you can find their GitHub here: https://github.com/cdozdil/OptiScaler
