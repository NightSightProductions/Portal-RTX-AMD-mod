 Instructions:
  1. Select your OS
  2. Select your architecture
  3. Drag and drop contents of dxvk-patch into .trex folder in Portal RTX bin
  4. Drag and drop one of the rtx.conf presets into Portal RTX directory, make sure to replace existing rtx.conf (Optional for RDNA 3 and higher)
  
 FSR 3.1 can be toggled through ALT + X and changing upscaler to DLSS

 Warning: While in ALT + X dev menu, do not go to the remix graphics menu, this will revert some changes and reduce performance (Only if using TAA-U or NIS, Does not affect FSR)

 If you need support, you can join our discord through the mod site

  How to know your architecture:

   RDNA 2: 6000 series, 600m series
   RDNA 3: 7000 series, 700m series
   RDNA 3.5: 8000 series 800m series
   RDNA 4: 9000 series

   If you are on RDNA 4 or higher, you don't really need the mod presets, but if you want extra performance, you can use RDNA 3 for the best results

Note: Handhelds with Z1/Z1 Extreme or higher APUs use 700m/800m graphics, A BC-250 (PS5 APU) is technically pre RDNA 2 but does support hardware RayTracing

 We would love feedback for other GPUs
