# Portal RTX AMD mod
We here at NightSightProductions think you should be able to experience Portal RTX without the need for a RTX GPU, so we pushed the limits of AMD hardware once again, This mod includes a runtime patch for RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 and MORE! to help performance, We also included custom presets based on extensive testing and research for both RDNA 2 and 3. This mod also now adds FSR 3.1 into the game, which provides superior upscaling compared to the previous NIS and TAA-U
Built for Windows and Linux

You'll find instructions in the READ ME.txt file

Whether you want to play at a high frame rate or high resolution, we got you covered with this mod.
we hope you enjoy what we've done and hope to see you use some of our other projects sometime in the future
